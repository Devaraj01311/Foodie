#  Foodie â€“ Online Food Ordering & Delivery Platform

**Foodie** is a full-stack **MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that enables users to browse restaurants, order food online, and track their orders in real-time. Restaurants can manage menus, accept or reject orders, and update order statuses, which are communicated to users via email.

## How It Works

1. **User Journey**:

   * User signs up or logs in â†’ browses restaurants â†’ adds food items to the cart â†’ places an order.
   * The order is saved in MongoDB and assigned to a captain.

2. **Restaurant & Captain Journey**:

   * Restaurant receives new orders â†’ accepts or rejects requests â†’ updates order status.
   * Captains are notified and assist in delivering orders.

3. **Order Tracking**:

   * Users receive email notifications as their order progresses.
